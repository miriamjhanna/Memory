# Memory
Android Studio memory matching card game.

Players may play the game with either a 4x3, or a 5x4 card board. The app opens to the Home Screen where players can select which board they want to use. The game tracks the number of matches and misses for each round of the game. At the end, users are asked if they want to play again. If they select yes, they will play on a newly shuffled board of the same size. If they select no, they will be taken back to the Home Screen. 

Memory.apk is located in app/build/outputs/apk/debug.
