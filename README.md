# Memory
Android memory matching card game developed with Android Studio, Java and XML.

Players may play the game with either a 4x3, or a 5x4 card board. Players must also select a card theme from: Simple Cartoon Icon (Default), Emojis, and Playing Cards. The app opens to the Home Screen where players can select which board and card theme they want to use. When users select a card theme option, a small description of the theme appears below the selection. The game tracks the number of matches and misses for each round of the game. At the end, users are asked if they want to play again. If they select yes, they will play on a newly shuffled board of the same size. If they select no, they will be taken back to the Home Screen.
